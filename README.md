# worksday_app

This is my first app with flutter. It's mainly used to get used to flutter so it has a lot of code flaws. \
In the project I used some libraries:
 - image_picker: get image from gallery
 - speech_to_text: cover speech text. 
 - intl: datetime.
 - phlox_animations: get used to animation.
 - hive, hive_flutter: hive database.
